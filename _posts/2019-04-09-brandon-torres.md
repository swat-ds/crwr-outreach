My name is Brandon Torres and I am pursuing a special major in English Literature and Education with a Secondary Teacher Education Certificate in English and PA Certification to teach English as a Second Language. Because of an amazing middle school English teacher, I have always been interested in creative writing and have an ultimate dream of one day publishing a novel. Within my own teaching practice, I want to play the same role that many of my English Teachers did for me in school by also sparking my students’ interest in reading and writing and providing a space for them to develop as writers. Within this course, I was able to work with a predominantly Latinx high school student population at Olney High School in their Native Language Literacy course (Spanish). Though I am conversationally fluent in Spanish (having been raised by parents who only speak Spanish), this course further developed my skills in Spanish by situating me in a context where I was using Spanish for instruction and teaching.

Overall, I found this course to be extremely helpful in further developing not only as an educator but one who centers creative writing and expression as an important aspect to student learning.  I found poet Yolanda Wisher’s visit to the classroom one of the most transformative experiences so far in thinking about how education, activism and art are interlinked together (after this speech, I have made this the topic of my senior thesis). For a while now, I was struggling with the idea of “just” becoming an educator and how I sometimes believed that this work would not do enough to make change in the world. Hearing her led me to realize that education is one of the most transformative experiences for students and that art (esp. Creative writing) can be a powerful mode of expression for students.

## Synopsis of Lesson Plan
    
In one of my lessons I taught Angel Gonzalez Muniz’s “Primera Evocacion,” a poem that I happened to come by in Antologia de la poesia espanola (1939-1975) or Anthology of Spanish Poetry (1939-1975). But before even mentioning the text, I talked about my own fears as a child and asked students to discuss their own childhood fears with the person beside them. They were excited to then share these out loud, though I had to pose questions for them to further explain why they were scared of these things.

This small discussion was in preparation for the poem which, after providing some background to the poet, we read. The poem centered around the speaker’s perception of his mothers’ fears when he was little, with the implication that this fear was shared by him as well. After reading the poem, I asked students to discuss some questions about the poem that were meant to ensure that they comprehended what the poem said, but also to start conversation around what is really being portrayed. The students were soon debating whether the fear was only that of the mother or both the speaker and mother. I used this opportunity to encourage students to refer back to the text to support what they thought.

Afterwards, I moved the conversation towards the language of the text and how it works, specifically a verse towards the end that uses powerful imagery. I asked that students turn to it and this time as we read it, underline text that stuck out to them. Students shared the lines they had chosen and why they thought that they liked them. I shared my own, emphasizing the strong use of imagery and details that help us as readers visualize the poem. I encouraged students to aim for this type of descriptiveness in their own poetry as we embarked on our own writing process.

I moved onto the writing activity which required students to take out a piece of paper and write a statement that began with “I am afraid of…” (in Spanish). Afterwards, we passed this paper to the next person who added a line to the poem, and repeated this process until the paper returned to the original owner. At the end of the lesson, we collected the students’ work.
