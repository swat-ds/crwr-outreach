I am really glad that I was able to take this course. It offered me a break from my STEM heavy work, but also expanded my idea of creative writing. I feel less scared about not following literary conventions, and that has made writing even more fun. Additionally, I had no idea I would love working with fifth graders at SRS so much. Being in the classroom and seeing the creative process taking place before my eyes in a ten year old was so inspiring. I cannot believe how great their poems were.  

## Synopsis of ‘Fruitful Creations’ (aka the Moon Fruit lesson) 

This lesson encourages students to utilize their creativity and writing skills in describing the aesthetics of the ‘moon fruit’, a rare and exotic fruit sold in one particular fruit and vegetable stand (spoiler: moon fruits aren’t real). The literary model that inspired this idea is the poem ‘The Fruit and Vegetable Stand’ by Susan Efird. 

To get the ball rolling, I ask every student to tell the class what their favorite fruits and vegetables are. Ideally, students get excited about finding out that they have similar interests and/or are reminded of fruits and vegetables they forgot about. Then we quietly read Efird’s poems to ourselves, circling unfamiliar words and underlining phrases that stood out to us. For the poetry analysis, I first go over the words that students didn’t understand. I ask if any student have a guess as to what the word means based on the context clues in the poem, and then I share the definition. Afterwards, students share the phrases that stood out to them, and we use those to talk about the poem and piece together the image Efird is describing. We conclude that Efird uses a lot of imagery and describes the fruits and vegetables using a lot of human characteristics. 

Then we transition into a class writing activity. The students vote on a vegetable to write about, and on the board, we create a poem to describe the vegetable. I ask questions that prompt the students to talk about the vegetable as if it has human-like qualities. Students raise their hands to either offer a line for the poem or give a suggestion to change an existing line. Once the poem has ten lines, and the students are satisfied with the result, we move to individual poetry writing. 

I pass around five fruits that I picked up from the store that I think have cool physical qualities that might inspire the students. I explain that I had gotten the fruits from Efird’s stand and that I had bought one more fruit that I wasn’t going to show them— the moon fruit. Then I challenge them to write another 10-line poem to describe this moon fruit based on what they think it looks like. I put up questions on the board to generate ideas (i.e. How are the seeds arranged?, What does the color remind you of?, What does the moon fruit smell like?, etc.). I also leave the class poem on the board. I remind them of the Efird poem they have by their elbows and the actual fruits migrating around the classroom. Then the class settles down to start writing. 
After approximately fifteen minutes of quiet writing time, I ask students to share their poems to the class if they want to. Instead of clapping, I ask the students to snap for the young poet after they’ve read their moon fruit poem. For students who didn’t want to share the entirety of their poem, I ask them to share one line that they liked in their poem. 

Finally, we conclude with a brief reflection on the students’ writing processes. I ask them questions like what they were thinking about as they were writing and what was the hardest part of describing the moon fruit. Then, I pull out a picture of what I imagine a moon fruit to look like and reveal that moon fruits don’t apologize exist…
